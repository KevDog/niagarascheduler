## Academic Integrity

Academic honesty – being honest and truthful in academic settings, especially in the communication and presentation of ideas – is required to experience and fulfill the mission of Niagara University. Academic dishonesty – being untruthful, deceptive, or dishonest in academic settings in any way – subverts the university mission, harms faculty and students, damages the reputation of the university, and diminishes public confidence in higher education.

All members of the university community share the responsibility for creating conditions that support academic integrity. Students must abstain from any violations of academic integrity and set examples for each other by assuming full responsibility for their academic and personal development, including informing themselves about and following the university's academic integrity policy.

Violations of academic integrity include but are not limited to the following categories: cheating; plagiarism; fabrication; falsification or sabotage of research data; destruction or misuse of the university's academic resources, alteration or falsification of academic records; academic misconduct; complicity; and copyright violation. This policy applies to all courses, program requirements, and learning contexts in which academic credit is offered, including experiential and service-learning courses, study abroad programs, internships, student teaching and the like.

Please refer to the undergraduate catalogue for Niagara University's policy on academic integrity or access the policy online.
