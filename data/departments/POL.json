We seek to nurture student appreciation of law and legal reasoning, other cultures and political systems, and the role of the United States in the world community. We are dedicated to the development of the whole student, one who is culturally sensitive and able to apply qualitative and quantitative methodologies to political, economic, social, cultural, gender-based, and legal questions. We encourage students to consider the ethical implications of policies and governmental actions, and to become active citizens at both the local and global levels.\n\nThe breadth and diversity of political science makes it a discipline well suited for answering the major issues challenging the world of the 21st century.",
