    "mission_statement": "The French Program at Niagara University focuses on creating globalized citizens who, through studying a language that is spoken on every continent, cultivate new ways to engage with the world. The program progresses from language classes to courses on the history, literature, and art of the French speaking world, culminating in an immersive study-abroad experience.\n\nWith the world becoming more connected and globalized, the need to engage with and truly understand other cultures, and not just translate from one language to the next, is equally on the rise. Studies show that bilingual individuals on average make a higher salary and have more job prospects than their monolingual counterparts. Given that French is spoken on every continent, French majors have the opportunity to put their skills to use in almost any sector and open the doors to a future anywhere in the world.\n\nStudents at Niagara learn French in small classes designed to give them individual attention. Our courses focus on building a strong foundation of proficiency in the language while exposing students to the diverse French-speaking cultures of the world. The classes then progress from language-focused to courses on the history, literature, and art of the French-speaking world, culminating in an immersive study-abroad experience.\n\nThe flexible BA in French gives every student at Niagara University the opportunity to double major, rounding out their marketability and preparing them for any career they decide to pursue. Students can also choose to add on a French minor to any degree.",
