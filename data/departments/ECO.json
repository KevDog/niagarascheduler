Microeconomics focuses on the analysis of specific economic units such as the consumer, firm, or industry. Upon completion of this course the student will have an understanding of both consumer and firm behavior as well as the basic models of industry market structure. In ECO 102, these concepts were introduced in a non-technical manner. The purpose of this course is to expand and build upon the fundamental microeconomic concepts covered in ECO 102. These intermediate economic concepts will be applied to a wide range of private decision making and public policy issues. While many of the underlying ideas presented in the course should be familiar to students, the intermediate treatment will be more formal and mathematically rigorous than in principles of economics courses.",
