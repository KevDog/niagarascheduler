    "mission_statement": "The Spanish program at Niagara University focuses on developing linguistic fluency while building global awareness, cultural understanding, and analytical thinking. This versatile major gives students the skills to communicate effectively with those around them, expanding their personal and professional horizons and empowering them to engage with Hispanic communities.\n\nStudying Spanish at Niagara University gives students the opportunity to learn, practice, and refine their use of the Spanish language. Our small class sizes ensure individualized attention, provide ample opportunity for the development of essential speaking and comprehension skills, and build a strong sense of community. The Spanish major is also flexible enough to combine with other academic programs and study abroad. Students graduate with a high level of proficiency, a greater understanding of the world around them, and the confidence they need to use their language skills professionally.\n\nOutside of the classroom, we offer a variety of activities that allow students to engage first-hand with Hispanic cultures while building lasting friendships. Informal conversation hours, film nights, guest speakers, and live music all help bring the language to life.",
