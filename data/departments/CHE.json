    "mission_statement": "The B.S. in Chemistry major is certified by the American Chemical Society (ACS) to provide foundational training in all areas of chemistry. Many B.S. chemistry students continue into research-oriented careers and/or further graduate studies in chemistry, forensics, materials science, environmental science, or medicine.\n\nThe B.S. in Biochemistry major emphasizes additional study in biology and the chemistry of biological organisms. This major is particularly popular among pre-health students pursuing careers in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and allied fields.\n\nThe B.A. in Chemistry major offers a high level of flexibility in the choice of upper-level courses. This major is popular with students who wish to apply their interest in chemistry to careers in business, law, or public policy. Students may choose courses to fulfill a 4+1 B.A. in chemistry/M.B.A in business. Additionally, through the NU College of Education, our department supports programs that provide specialized chemistry training for educators teaching students across various age levels.",
