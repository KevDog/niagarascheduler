    "mission_statement": "The American Sign Language and Deaf Studies program is the largest minor on campus. The minor allows students the ability to earn a \u201cdegree with a difference.\u201d Interested students are encouraged to start the courses early in their studies at Niagara University due to the progressive sequencing of the courses. We realize that many students like to explore courses before deciding. You are welcome to sit in on a class or two, come to our events, and/or meet with our professors individually.\n\nThe ASL/DS program offers small class sizes to enhance the individualized learning experience. Our faculty come from diverse backgrounds and are able to provide our students with a wide range of perspectives in the field of ASL/DS. Classes range from beginner ASL to conversational ASL with the possibility of having an internship after completion of the minor.\n\nCurriculum",
