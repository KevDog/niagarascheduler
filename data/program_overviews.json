  "Women\u2019s Studies (Minor)": {
    "url": "https://www.niagara.edu/programs/womens-studies/",
    "overview": "Women\u2019s studies creates an interdisciplinary framework for analyzing the historical, economic, political, social and cultural experiences of women.\n\nWomen\u2019s studies courses strengthen critical inquiry as students learn to think and read through the lens of women\u2019s experiences and lives. Women\u2019s studies courses are premised on the assumption that sexism exits in North America, as well as in most places in the world, and has a profound impact on women\u2019s lives. Students examine gender as a social construct which is essential to understanding power relations, social customs, and institutions.\n\nVirtually all graduate programs and professions require a consideration of gender issues. A background in women\u2019s studies is thus useful for further academic studies. It also prepares students for a variety of occupations, such as law, criminal justice, business, social welfare, healthcare, counseling, human resources, economic development, education, journalism, literature, the arts, and community organizing at the local, national or international levels. Look here for a list of the things you can do with a minor in women\u2019s studies!\n\nThe minor in women\u2019s studies requires the completion of WMS 200 and four electives. With the permission of the women\u2019s studies coordinator, another course on a women\u2019s related issue or internship or co-op may be substituted for one of the required courses. Other courses include those that address women\u2019s studies issues such as gender, race, class, etc."
